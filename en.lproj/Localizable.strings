You do not need to create a user account in order to use the application.
The application does not collect user's personal data. In order to estimate the distance of the aplication user with respect to the points of interest (e.g. gas stations or parking lots), the application uses the GPS coordinates of the user device. Coordinates are used exclusively locally, i.e. they are not forwarded outside the application.
Use the application in a safe way - park properly before using it.
Do not use the application in a way that will distract you, as this may endanger you and other road users.
The application is available in Montenegrin and English.";
